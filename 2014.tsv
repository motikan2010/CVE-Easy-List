CVE-2014-3624	2017-10-30	n/a	Apache Traffic Server 5.1.x before 5.1.1 allows remote attackers to bypass access restrictions by leveraging failure to properly tunnel remap requests using CONNECT.
CVE-2014-3625	2014-11-20	n/a	Directory traversal vulnerability in Pivotal Spring Framework 3.0.4 through 3.2.x before 3.2.12, 4.0.x before 4.0.8, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via unspecified vectors, related to static resource handling.
CVE-2014-3626	2018-03-19	Grails by Pivotal	The Grails Resource Plugin often has to exchange URIs for resources with other internal components. Those other components will decode any URI passed to them. To protect against directory traversal the Grails Resource Plugin did the following: normalized the URI, checked the normalized URI did not step outside the appropriate root directory (e.g. the web application root), decoded the URI and checked that this did not introduce additional /../ (and similar) sequences. A bug was introduced where the Grails Resource Plugin before 1.2.13 returned the decoded version of the URI rather than the normalized version of the URI after the directory traversal check. This exposed a double decoding vulnerability. To address this issue, the Grails Resource Plugin now repeatedly decodes the URI up to three times or until decoding no longer changes the URI. If the decode limit of 3 is exceeded the URI is rejected. A side-effect of this is that the Grails Resource Plugin is unable to serve a resource that includes a '%' character in the full path to the resource. Not all environments are vulnerable because of the differences in URL resolving in different servlet containers. Applications deployed to Tomcat 8 and Jetty 9 were found not not be vulnerable, however applications deployed to JBoss EAP 6.3 / JBoss AS 7.4 and JBoss AS 7.1 were found to be vulnerable (other JBoss versions weren't tested). In certain cases JBoss returns JBoss specific vfs protocol urls from URL resolution methods (ClassLoader.getResources). The JBoss vfs URL protocol supports resolving any file on the filesystem. This made the directory traversal possible. There may be other containers, in addition to JBoss, on which this vulnerability is exposed.
CVE-2014-3627	2014-12-05	n/a	The YARN NodeManager daemon in Apache Hadoop 0.23.0 through 0.23.11 and 2.x before 2.5.2, when using Kerberos authentication, allows remote cluster users to change the permissions of certain files to world-readable via a symlink attack in a public tar archive, which is not properly handled during localization, related to distributed cache.

CVE-2014-3632	2014-10-07	n/a	The default configuration in a sudoers file in the Red Hat openstack-neutron package before 2014.1.2-4, as used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Open Stack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, allows remote attackers to gain privileges via a crafted configuration file. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2013-6433 regression.
CVE-2014-3633	2014-10-06	n/a	The qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune function in qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt before 1.2.9, when a disk has been hot-plugged or removed from the live image, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or read sensitive heap information via a crafted blkiotune query, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.

CVE-2014-3648	2022-07-01	Jboss Aerogear	The simplepush server iterates through the application installations and pushes a notification to the server provided by deviceToken. But this is user controlled. If a bogus applications is registered with bad deviceTokens, one can generate endless exceptions when those endpoints can't be reached or can slow the server down by purposefully wasting it's time with slow endpoints.
